# Hangman
Welcome! I hope you enjoy this fun game of Hangman. It was one of my favourite games growing up which is why I decided to create it and it purely using Python.

# Strategy plan
Hangman is a short game that can be played by people of all ages. The goal is to guess a letter, if you guess the correct letter it shows the letter in the correct location of that word. Continue guessing until you have guessed all the correct letters in the word. Once you have guessed all letters in the word you have won!
